Powershell

###

Windows PowerShell is the next-generation scripting environment created by Microsoft. 
It’s designed to provide a unified solution for Windows scripting and automation, able to access the wide range of technologies such as
.NET, COM, and WMI
through a single tool. Since its release in 2006, PowerShell has become the central
component of any Windows management solution. In addition, due to PowerShell’s
comprehensive support for .NET, it also has broad application potential outside of the
system administration space. PowerShell can be used for text processing, general
scripting, build management, creating test frameworks, and so on.
